### Objective
For each task, write your answers and findings in a README file together with any
code.  
#### 1 REFLECTIONS
##### 1.1 SHOOTING
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying.  

##### Solution
- The shot did not hit the man
- The shot hit the man but was not fatal
  - Hit in the knee/other non-fatal place 
  - The gun was a BB/toy gun 
- The shot hit the man and was fatal, but he was wearing protection (helmet/vest/other) 
- The shot hit the man, was fatal, but he was revived at the hospital
- The shot hit the man and was fatal, but the setting was artificial reality

##### 1.2 ALIEN
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can.    

##### Solution
- Go to the bathroom sink
- Take the toothbrush head from the holder and attach it to the toothbrush body
- Turn on the water faucet  on cold and rinse the toothbrush bristles on the toothbrush head
- Turn off the water faucet
- Put the assembled toothbrush by the sink
- Pick up the toothpaste and unscrew the lid and hold the toothpaste in your right hand
- Pick up the assembled toothbrush with your left hand
- Push out some toothpaste unto the toothbrush bristles on the toothbrush head
	- Should be about the size of a pea.
- Put down the toothpaste
- Take the toothbrush in your right hand and press the "ON" button
- Move the toothbrush towards your open mouth 
  - Place the rotating toothbrush bristles onto the front a tooth and leave it there for around 3 seconds.
  - Move the rotating toothbrush bristles to the top of the same tooth and leave it there for 3 seconds.
  - Move the rotating toothbrush bristles to the back of the same tooth and leave it there for 3 seconds.
  - Repeat the three steps above for all other teeth
- Turn off the toothbrush
- Once again move the toothbrush towards your open mouth 
- Scrape the top of your tongue from back to front with the toothbrush bristles
- Disassemble the toothbrush and toothbrush head
- Turn on the water faucet on cold again
- Rinse the toothbrush body 
- Rinse the toothbrush head and bristles
- Turn off the water faucet
- Put the toothbrush body in the holder
- Put the toothbrush head in the holder

#### 2 TWO KATAS
Complete the following two katas using TDD. Make sure to follow the TDD mantra,
“red-green-refactor”:
- Red: Write a failing test.
- Green: Write the smallest implementation to make your test pass.
- Refactor: Make the necessary refactoring to the implementation and tests, in
order to remove code redundancy
A fuller explanation of the TDD steps can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development

Remember, the point of these katas is not to solve the coding tasks as such. The point
is to use TDD. Thus, if your code contains a solution to the task, but no tests, the
solution is not accepted.

##### 2.1 FAHRENHEIT-TO-CELCIUS CONVERTER
Use TDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter.
Use TDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter.

##### Solution
- [Temperature Converter Class](https://github.com/Castau/2nd_semester_individual_assignments/blob/main/test/One/src/main/java/ConvertTemperature.java)  
  - [Type Enum](https://github.com/Castau/2nd_semester_individual_assignments/blob/main/test/One/src/main/java/FromTempType.java)
- [Temperature Test Class](https://github.com/Castau/2nd_semester_individual_assignments/blob/main/test/One/src/test/java/TemperatureTest.java)

##### 2.2 ROMAN NUMERAL KATA
Implement an “Arabic numeral to roman numeral” converter using TDD. Follow the
standard form of roman numerals – the rules can be found on the wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form.

##### Solution
- [Arabic to Roman Converter Class](https://github.com/Castau/2nd_semester_individual_assignments/blob/main/test/One/src/main/java/ConvertRomanNumber.java)  
- [Arabic to Roman Test Class](https://github.com/Castau/2nd_semester_individual_assignments/blob/main/test/One/src/test/java/RomanTest.java)

#### 3 GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TDD
Write your notes in a readme file regarding the TDD process, reflecting on the
following questions.
- What was positive and good about using TDD?
  - It makes you think about the result of the code first instead of the logic
  - It makes you think about the failing scenarios from the start
  - It ensures well-tested code
- What was annoying or difficult?
	- Nothing in particular was annoying or difficult. From a practical standpoint I think I prefer to write code and tests interchangeably/continuously, as that is faster (for me). 
- What surprised you?
	- Nothing really was surprising. We have done TDD before so this was not new, but it was nice to try it out again.
- Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?
	- I don't think so, no. I'm usually okay in regards to implementing test. In the event that I don't I don't see how TDD would help in that regard.
