#### 3 GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TDD
- **What was positive and good about using TDD?**
  - It makes you think about the result of the code first instead of the logic
  - It makes you think about the failing scenarios from the start
  - It ensures well-tested code
- **What was annoying or difficult?**
	- Nothing in particular was annoying or difficult. From a practical standpoint I think I prefer to write code and tests interchangeably/continuously, as that is faster (for me). 
- **What surprised you?**
	- Nothing really was surprising. We have done TDD before so this was not new, but it was nice to try it out again.
- **Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?**
	- I don't think so, no. I'm usually okay in regards to implementing test. In the event that I don't I don't see how TDD would help in that regard.
